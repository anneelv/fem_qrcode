## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

In this project I learned few things:
1. Using imported fonts from google fonts
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> 
```
2. Styling with CSS and bordering
```
img {
    position: relative;
    display: block;
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}
```


### Continued development

This is the first time I tried to design frontend using HTML and especially CSS. Moving forward, I would like to use framework such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create this project.
